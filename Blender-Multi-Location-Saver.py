# This Python script for Blender automates saving your projects and creating backups in multiple locations after each save. The script listens for a save event and then copies the .blend file and its backup versions (.blend1, .blend2, etc.) to specified backup directories.

# Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key steps:

# Backup Paths: You can customize the list of paths where backups are saved by adding new directories in backup_paths.
# Save and Backup: After saving the current .blend file, the script locates all associated .blend* files and copies them to the backup locations.
# Backup Trigger: The script is triggered after each save, thanks to the bpy.app.handlers.save_post.append(on_save) handler.
